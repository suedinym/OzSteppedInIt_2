# OzSteppedInIt_2
Part2: A collection of images of Dr Oz's actual tweets from before he started his senate campaign

He repurposed the account from his show as his campaign account, and then his card/signature wound up hilariously juxtaposed on his old tweets.

There are two collections of 36

The first collection is probably the best ones, but why not collect them all?

Suggested Hashtag #OzSteppedInItAgain

Tried not to use tweets with someone else's information (like his personal trainer) or nasty health issues like psoriasis, drinking, opiod crisis etc. 

Some suggestions for use inlude - using the one about water's health benefits where he's posting about fracking.

Some, like 'boost your immunity' may be funnier if posted in response to Mastriano, Rudy, Junior, etc, as if he's suggesting it to them.

And of course anything about vegetables and crudite is amusing.

h/t to Comfortably Numb (for finding these in the first place and filtering Oz's tweets making these easier to find)
